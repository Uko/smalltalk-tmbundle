# Textmate Bundle for SmallTalk development

## Install

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/tomas-stefano/smalltalk-tmbundle.git "Smalltalk.tmbundle"
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

## Open files

* If you have problems to open smalltalk files, try to click with the right button and select **"Treat files with .st extension as a text"** and dont worry because the bundle will work anyway(You will only need to do this once, IF need).

### Have fun! :)
